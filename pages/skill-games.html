                These little characters, consisting of a head and five black
                bars, are called Stickmans. In every type of game, including
                shooting, adventure, address, and even sports, they are the

            <h2>What is a skill game?</h2>
            <p>
              Skill games call on the dexterity of players and will generally
              offer gameplay based on precise actions to be performed that will
              require some technique and skill. Another peculiarity of skill
              games is that the luck factor doesn't exist, nothing will be left
              to chance and your progress or improvement in the game will be due
              only to your skills. Skill games offer mechanics that are easy to
              understand but often difficult to master, the goal is to play to
              progress and improve. The wide variety of titles will allow you to
              find gameplay that suits your mood of the moment, whether it's
              running as far as possible in the meanders of an Aztec temple,
              making jumps and figures on a trampoline, dancing to the rhythm on
              music or grow your snake by competing against other players
              online!

            <h2>What is the origin of skill games?</h2>
            <p>
              Skill games have been around since ancient times and are probably
              the most played games in the world. From the first wooden spinning
              top (toton) to marbles, mikados and other ring-throwing games,
              physical skill games have entertained children and adults alike.
              But this genre is also very popular in video games and
              particularly with browser games because the principle of simple
              gameplay adapts perfectly to the medium. In Geometry Dash for
              example, the player controls a small square that they will have to
              make progress at full speed from platform to platform while
              avoiding the many traps. The title demands great precision in your
              actions as well as unwavering concentration. If you prefer urban
              sports then Skate Hooligan will offer you many challenges to test
              your keyboard dexterity. The skill games are as diverse as they
              are varied and you can even find the heroes of some of your
              favorite licenses such as Assassin's Creed or Raving Rabbids.
            </p>
