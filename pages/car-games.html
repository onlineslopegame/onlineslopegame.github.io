            <h2>What is a car game?</h2>
            In car games, 4-wheeled bolides will be at the heart of the
            gameplay, whether it's driving them directly like a racing driver or
            interacting with it to make them move on circuits or all kinds of
            winding tracks. Car games will give you thrills in various events;
            rally, circuit racing or simply free driving there will be something
            for everyone. There are also the parking games which will offer you
            to drive cars with delicacy to park them on specific locations
            without breaking anything. If you are a seasoned driver or a fan of
            powerful cars then free car games will be ideal for you to have fun
            playing right in your browser.

            <h2>What is the origin of car games?</h2>
            Car games have been around since the beginning of video game history
            and have always been a very popular genre among gamers. One of the
            first of these was Pole Position, which was hugely successful in
            1982 on arcade machines and then on Atari computers. A little later
            in 1994, a 3D NASCAR game called Daytona USA enchanted racing
            enthusiasts by offering a realism that had never been achieved so
            far. Other car games like the Gran Turismo and Forza series have
            honored the most beautiful and powerful cars in the world by giving
            players the opportunity to drive hundreds of them on many different
            circuits. Free car games are an ideal way to experience this
            legendary genre while having fun directly in your browser without
            any download.
