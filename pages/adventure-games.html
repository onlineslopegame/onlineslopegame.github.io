                will find that adventure games satisfy their need for

                crimes, or operate as a merchant to expand your company.

            <h2>What are adventure games?</h2>
            <p>
              Adventure games will allow you to discover fantastic worlds,
              explore fabulous universes tinged with magic, extraordinary
              creatures like in Dynamoms World, and priceless treasures to find.
              Most often you will lead a hero, or a group of adventurers in
              search of glory, wealth, power and who will have to many dangers
              to reach their objectives. You will also have to meet charismatic
              characters and will have to face monsters and other creatures who
              will try to spread chaos. But adventure games can also be
              simulations or management games or even platform games requiring
              agility and coordination.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the origin of adventure games?</h2>
            <p>
              The first adventure game is a text game for educational purposes
              called The Oregon Trail, distributed in 1971 for schools and
              universities and released commercially on Apple 2 in 1978. Other
              cult games have marked generations of players by their innovations
              and their fantastic worlds to explore. Prince of Persia (1989) is
              one of the first platform games, Myst (1991) is one of the first
              point and click/exploration game to become cult. Later platformer
              games such as Sonic The Hedgehog will bring their stones to the
              vast edifice of video games. All the free adventure games
              available on Snokido have been inspired by this rich video game
              history that established the codes of modern games.
