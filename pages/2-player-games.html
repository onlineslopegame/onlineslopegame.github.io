                You can challenge your pals to cooperative games on the same
                computer while you play two player games. Each player can
                control and develop their own character by sharing the keyboard;
                in certain games, up to four players can play simultaneously.
                Other games allow you to embark on an adventure with others; to
                advance, you must pool your resources and abilities. Games for
                two players provide a rich and frequently humorous gaming
                experience, making them ideal for entertaining friends on a fun
                night out.
